Hi there!

This is an assignment constructed for you to practice implementing interfaces and classes.

Perform the following tasks to complete the assignment:

1. Crate a factory of your liking!
2. The factory should produce any item you want!
3. The factory needs workers!
4. The factory needs to be setup properly before it starts producing! Do this in the constructor! This means occupying machines with workers and filling the machines with parts.
5. When it produces items, an unfinished item is passed from machine to machine!
6. Good luck!
7. Make sure someone can try out the produced item eventually!
