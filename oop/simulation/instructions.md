Hi there!

This is an assignment constructed for you to practice implementing interfaces and classes.

Perform the following tasks to complete the assignment:

1. Instantiate the objects that are to partake in the simulation of YOUR life!
    - This means the buildings you visit, the activities you perform, the people you interact with and yourself.
2. Create classes to represent your life, activities, hobbies, studies, meals.
3. Implement and add functions to these classes to make sure they represent your reality.
4. Make sure the functions log information to the console about what actions are being simulated.
    - This should lead to your simulation logging information that reads like a story, WHAT IS YOUR LIFE LIKE?!
5. Perform the simulation.
6. Get examinated.
